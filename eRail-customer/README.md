  <h1 style="color: #333; text-align: center">Reseach Problem</h1>

  <p>The railway line beyond Rambukkana to Badulla in Main Line, Peradeniya to Matale in Matale Line, Polgahawela to Anuradhapura in Northern Line, Mahawa to Trincomalee and Batiicalo Lines, Negombo to Noornagar in Puttlam Line and Narahenpitata to Avissavella in Kelani Valley Line are still used Tablet or Token system as railway signal system. Only one train at a time is allowed to travel on this single-track route. Therefore, tablet methods are used to carry out related communication. Also, semaphore signal is a signal exchange method used at stations that use tablet or token methods. Also, in the scheduled track is switched, and it is done manually. But all these methods have some problems. If the train suffers a fault during the train movement, the train will not be allowed to run until the tablet related to the train is given to the nearest station. Due to this, all the trains on that route are delayed. Also, when a train leaves the station, the train-related tablet is issued, the track has been properly switched and the semaphore signal has been issued, all three factors must be integrated, and all those factors must be confirmed. But in the existing system, the tablet release and the track switch system are not connected. Also, the most important weakness is that all this is done by human. Even human error can cause train delays and train collisions. Therefore, there is some insecurity in the existing system.</p>

<p>The railway system in Sri Lanka is facing several issues that hinder its effectiveness and reliability. The current manual system, with logbooks, is outdated and reduces efficiency. Passengers struggle to arrive at their destination due to the unreliable train transit mechanism. For example, from Anuradhapura railway station to Badulla railway station it shows as no train their system. Furthermore, the railway cargo system does not have live tracking, making it difficult to know the exact location of a shipment or if it was transferred to the correct train. This lack of information deprives customers of the knowledge they need to effectively use the railway system. In conclusion, there is a need for improvement in the railway system to enhance its reliability and provide better service to passengers and cargo customers.</p>

<p>Passengers presently have no concept of when they will arrive at their destination or how long it will take to complete their journey. Because certain weather conditions and climatic changes might cause railway delays. However, passengers cannot predict how long a delay will last while they are traveling. Currently, sometimes due to the delay of the train, passenger can't view the extract viewpoint properly now. There is currently no social media platform available for users to share their rail travel experiences with other users who also enjoy taking trains. There is a significant problem with online rail ticket reservations, and that problem is that there are empty seats that are not reserved in the system. Railway suffers a loss from those seats.</p>

<h1 style="color: #333; text-align: center">Main Objective</h1> 

<p> The main objective is to develop and implement a comprehensive digital system for railway operations that encompasses tablet signals, control signals, automatic color light semaphore signals, virtual tour experiences, real-time train tracking, transit management, cargo tracking, and an auction method for seat reservation. By digitalizing tablet signals and control signals, efficient and accurate communication will be established between the station master and engine driver. The system will automatically generate color light semaphore signals based on tablet signals and track switching processes, optimizing signaling procedures. Additionally, a virtual tour experience will be developed to enhance the railway tourism industry, providing passengers and tourists with an immersive journey. Real-time train tracking will enable efficient management of transits and multiple line travel, while also allowing for cargo location tracking. Finally, an auction method for seat reservation will stimulate strong revenue generation, ensuring an effective and profitable seat reservation procedure. This comprehensive digital system aims to enhance the efficiency, safety, revenue generation, and overall passenger experience within the railway industry.
